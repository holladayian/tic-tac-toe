## Project Overview
For this project, we were required to make a working tic-tac-toe game from scratch. For this we used Javascript, HTML and CSS. To build this project we needed a few things:
- A player.js file that contains a Player class
- A way to save and retrieve each players wins from localStorage
- A game.js file that contains a Game class (this should contain both player instances)
- A way to keep track of the data for the game board
- A way to keep track of which player’s turn it currently is
- A way to check the Game’s board data for win conditions
- A way to detect when a game is a draw (no one has won)
- A way to save a winning Game’s board data to the correct player’s wins array
- A way to reset the Game’s board to begin a new game
- A main.js file that contains all DOM related JavaScript

<br/>


## Learning Goals
### Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- localStorage to persist data
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
<br />
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

<br/>
<br/>


## Wins
- Making a fully functional final project
- Having small, DRY, SRP function
- Understanding the separation of the DOM and data model
- Properly using the debugging dev tools to find and solve problems

<br/>


## Challenges
- I built the HTML and CSS first. This is okay, as long as you don't hook up the DOM and data model until you're done with both
- There was a lot of outside pressure on this project that made the timing difficult as well. I'm glad it turned out all right
